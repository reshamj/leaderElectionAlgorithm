# leaderElectionAlgorithm
The leader election problem is the process of designating a single node in a distributed network of autonomous nodes as the organizer of some task. Each node need to agree on whom among them will be the leader node, and the leader needs to announce itself. So there are two parts: leader selection and leader announcement (without deadlocks).
